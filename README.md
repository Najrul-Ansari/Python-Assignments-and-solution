# Python Basics - Assignment

In this Github repository, I have solved some basic python assignmnet problems during the couse of my data science.

Problems:
1. Simple Message: Store a message in a variable, and then print that message.
2. Store a message in a variable and print that message. Then change the 
value of your variable to a new message and print the new message.
3. Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to that person. 
Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to 
learn some Python today?”
4. Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the 
name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, 
including the quotation marks: Albert Einstein once said, “A person who 
never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
5. Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a 
variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in 
a new variable called message. Print your message.
6. Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that 
each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print 
statements to see the results. You should create four lines that look like 
this: print (5 + 3)
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once 
on each line.
7. Store your favourite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create 
a message that reveals your favourite number. Print that message.
8. Choose two of the programs you’ve written and add at least one comment 
to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs 
are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the 
top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the 
program does.
9. Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each 
person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
10.Start with the list you used in Exercise 9, but instead of just printing each 
person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should 
be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s
name.
11.Think of your favourite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a 
car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a 
series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a 
Honda motorcycle.”
